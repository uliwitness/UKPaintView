 Ã Why does lasso cut out a thin line gap every time?
-> Move selection removal and change code into UKPaintView.
-> Make select tool not revert lasso selections to rectangular when dragging them.
-> Select tool should also show right-to-left selections during tracking.
-> Better selection outline that doesn't pulse but instead uses two colors.
-> Make filled variants of shape tools.
-> Make text tool auto-resize its bounding box while typing.
